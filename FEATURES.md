# Capabilities.

**It does everything, so you don't have to.**

We designed the Universal Bootstrap to be the only tool you need. It is not just about installing software; it is about creating a perfect environment for creation.

## The Foundation
*The core technologies that power your work.*

*   **Java**: Enterprise-grade OpenJDK. Configured correctly.
*   **Python**: Your choice of the latest runtime or version 3.8.
*   **C / C++**: MinGW-w64 GCC & G++. Native. Fast.
*   **MySQL**: Full server installation. Running as a resilient background service.
*   **The Editor**: Visual Studio Code. The industry standard.
*   **Version Control**: Git. Essential for modern development.

## The Intelligence: `d1run`
*One command to rule them all.*

We realized that switching between `javac`, `g++`, and `python` breaks your flow. So we unified them. `d1run` is context-aware.

*   **Smart Compilation**: It doesn't just compile; it optimizes. C++ code is statically linked by default—build once, run anywhere.
*   **Auto-Linking**: It sees `include <mysql.h>` and automatically links the database libraries. You don't do a thing.
*   **Error Reporting**: It reads the cryptic compiler errors and translates them into human-readable fix suggestions.

## The Guardian: Auto-Push Monitor
*Your work, immortalized.*

*   **Silent Watcher**: A background daemon that monitors every keystroke difference.
*   **Intelligent Threshold**: Triggers a save only when you've done significant work (default: 500 lines).
*   **Bot Identity**: Uses a distinct "Code-Ninja" identity, keeping your personal commit history clean and professional.

## The Ecosystem
*A living, breathing system.*

*   **Self-Healing**: If a file is missing or a path is broken, the system detects it and repairs it.
*   **Auto-Update**: It stays in sync with the cloud. Always the latest version. Always the best features.
*   **Database Automation**: Need a fresh start? One click wipes and re-initializes your MySQL server with a clean schema and test data.

**Simple. Powerful. Essential.**
