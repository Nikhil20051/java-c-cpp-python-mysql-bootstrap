# Join Us.

**Help us build the perfect environment.**

We are building the definitive development experience for Windows. It is ambitious. It is difficult. And we want your help.

This project is part of the [**dmj.one**](https://dmj.one) initiative. We believe in free, accessible, and beautiful education for everyone.

## Philosophy

We are guided by the **Dream. Manifest. Journey.** ethos.

Before you write code, understand our values:
1.  **Democratize Access**: Technology should be accessible to everyone, regardless of background.
2.  **Beauty Matters**: Aesthetics are not an afterthought. They are the product.
3.  **Simplicity**: If you can remove a step, remove it. The best tools are invisible.

## How To Contribute

### Reporting Issues
If you find a bug, tell us.
But don't just say "it broke." Tell us the story.
*   What were you trying to do?
*   What happened instead?
*   What version of Windows are you on?

### Pull Requests
We welcome code. But we have high standards.
1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  **Branch** off.
3.  **Write** clean, documented code.
4.  **Test** it. If it breaks the "One Click" promise, we cannot merge it.
5.  **Submit** a Pull Request.

## Standards

**PowerShell Scripts**
*   Write for humans, not just machines.
*   Use `try/catch`. Handle errors gracefully.
*   Document your functions.

**Documentation**
*   Be concise.
*   Be clear.
*   Inspire confidence.
