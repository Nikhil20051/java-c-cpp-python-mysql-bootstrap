# Universal Bootstrap.

**Complexity, managed.**

We believe that to create great software, you shouldn't have to fight your computer. You should just code.

For years, setting up a development environment on Windows has been a struggle. Mismatched versions. Broken system paths. Endless configuration files. It kills your creativity before you even begin.

We asked ourselves: **What if you could turn a fresh computer into a professional engineering station in one click?**

So we built it.

## The Experience

Universal Bootstrap isn't just a script. It is an intelligent orchestration engine that manages your entire development lifecycle.

It downloads the tools. It configures the environment. It initializes the database. It validates the installation.

It is effortless. It is robust. **It just works.**

## What Is Inside?

We didn't just bundle software. We integrated the industry's most powerful standards into one cohesive ecosystem:

*   **Java**: The latest Enterprise OpenJDK.
*   **Python**: Fully configured and path-managed.
*   **C & C++**: A professional, static-linking MinGW compiler suite.
*   **MySQL**: A production-grade database server, installed as a native service.
*   **The Tools**: Visual Studio Code and Git, optimized for immediate use.

## One More Thing...

We reinvented how you execute code.

Traditionally, running a C++ program with database connections involves complex linking commands. Running Java requires classpath management.

We built **`d1run`**.
It is a unified execution engine. It understands your code.

*   You type: `d1run main.cpp` → It compiles, links MySQL, and runs.
*   You type: `d1run app.py` → It executes instantly.

No flags. No configuration. Pure focus.

## How To Start

You do not need to know Git. You do not need to be an expert.

1.  **Download**: Click the green "Code" button above and select **Download ZIP**.
2.  **Extract**: Unzip the folder anywhere on your computer (e.g., `D:\Dev`).
3.  **Launch**: Open the folder and double-click **`start.bat`**.

Select **Option 1 (Full Install)**.
The software will handle the rest.

## Your Safety Net

We included an intelligent **Auto-Push Monitor**.
It quietly watches your workspace. If you write significant amounts of code, it enables a failsafe, automatically saving your progress to the cloud. You never lose an idea.

**Welcome to the future of development.**
