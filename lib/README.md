# Libraries.

**The engine room.**

This directory houses the connectivity drivers for Java.

## Automated Handling
The installation script manages this automatically. You generally do not need to touch this.

## Manual Intervention
If you are offline or the automation is blocked:

1.  **Download**: [MySQL Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/)
2.  **Extract**: Place logic inside this folder.
