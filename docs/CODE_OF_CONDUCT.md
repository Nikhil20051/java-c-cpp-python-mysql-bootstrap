# Code of Conduct.

**Respect. Empathy. Growth.**

We are here to learn and build. To ensure this community remains a place where "Dream. Manifest. Journey." thrives, we agree to a simple standard.

## The Standard

1.  **Be welcoming**: We were all beginners once. Treat every question with patience.
2.  **Be respectful**: Disagreement is fine. Disrespect is not.
3.  **Be constructive**: Critique the code, not the person.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Enforcement

Violations of this code will not be tolerated.
